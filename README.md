<h1> Cities-Api </h1>

### This program was developed with the objective of exemplifying the operation of a small api using Java, PostgreSQL and Heroku. It is able to list the existing cities and states in Brazil, as well as a list of all countries.

>⚠️ Status: Developing, all outputs are like Json not formatted.

>⚠️ Alert: A free version of Heroku was used, with this in a few days the site will be inactive or rather saying "hibernating".

### Thanks: All the content was developed thanks to the platform "Digital Inovation One", and the instructor André Gomes. Thank you for having made this great quality content available for free. 
### Below is the link of the "DIO" platform and the Github link of the project that was used as a basis.

##### Note: In the original project Docker was used with "PostgreSQL", but as I had some problems to make the connection between the docker postgre and the java libraries, I chose to use the postgree directly on the machine without the docker container, it was only used more to the end so that the tables were sent to Heroku.
